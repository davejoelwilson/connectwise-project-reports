# Implementation Notes and Learnings

## Frontend

### Text Color and Contrast (2025-02-12)

**Issue:**
- Default Tremor text colors were using light grays (text-gray-600)
- Poor contrast ratio made text difficult to read
- Inconsistent text colors across components

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Before
<Text className="text-gray-600">Content</Text>

// After
<Text className="text-black">Content</Text>

// Labels before
<Text className="text-sm text-gray-600">Label</Text>

// Labels after
<Text className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Label</Text>
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Main content text: Changed from `text-gray-600` to `text-black`
2. Section headers: Added `font-medium` and `text-black`
3. Labels: Changed to `text-gray-700` with `font-medium`
4. List items: Added `text-black` to ensure readability

**Components Updated:**
- ProgressCard
- RisksCard
- BlockersCard
- ResourceAnalysisCard
- RecommendationsCard
- TimelinePredictionCard

**Learning:**
- Always test UI components with actual content for readability
- Consider accessibility and contrast ratios from the start
- Use Tremor's design system but don't hesitate to override colors for better UX
- Maintain consistent text hierarchy:
  - Headers: Black, medium weight
  - Labels: Dark gray, medium weight
  - Content: Black, regular weight

## Backend

### API Response Handling (2025-02-12)

**Issue:**
- Analysis endpoint was trying to re-analyze JSON files instead of just serving them
- Unnecessary processing overhead

**Solution:**
```python
# Before
@app.get("/api/analysis/{project_id}")
async def get_project_analysis(project_id: int):
    analysis_file = Path(f"data/ai_analysis/project_{project_id}_ai_analysis.json")
    return analyze_project_file(str(analysis_file))

# After
@app.get("/api/analysis/{project_id}")
async def get_project_analysis(project_id: int):
    analysis_file = Path(f"data/ai_analysis/project_{project_id}_ai_analysis.json")
    with open(analysis_file) as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

**Learning:**
- Differentiate between analysis generation and serving pre-generated analysis
- Keep API endpoints simple and focused
- Use appropriate error handling for file operations
