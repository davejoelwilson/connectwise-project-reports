# Project Planning Document

This document outlines the planning and design aspects of the ConnectWise Project Reporting system. It serves as a reference for the overall architecture, key components, and milestones, and includes diagrams and additional notes for future enhancements.

## Overview
The system is designed to fetch, aggregate, and analyze data from ConnectWise, integrating asynchronous data collection, aggregation logic, and AI orchestration (using LangChain and Crew AI). The solution comprises a frontend for user interaction, a backend API for data handling, API wrappers for ConnectWise endpoints, data aggregation modules, and an AI orchestration pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram
Below is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the high-level architecture:

    B --> D[Aggregation Module];
    D --> E[AI Orchestration Module];
    E --> F[LLM & Prompt Chaining];
```

## Key Components
- **Frontend:** 
  - Streamlit UI for project selection and displaying reports.
- **Backend:** 
  - FastAPI server providing endpoints to interact with the frontend.
- **ConnectWise API Module:** 
  - Asynchronous HTTP requests (using httpx) to interact with ConnectWise endpoints for projects, time entries, tickets, and notes.
- **Aggregation Module:** 
  - Aggregates data from different API endpoints into a unified report structure.
- **AI Orchestration Module:** 
  - Integrates AI capabilities (LangChain and Crew AI) for dynamic prompt chaining and processing of aggregated data.

## Milestones
1. **Base Setup and Repository Initialization**
   - Setting up project structure, dependency management, and version control.
2. **ConnectWise API Integration**
   - Implementing asynchronous wrappers for ConnectWise endpoints.
3. **Data Aggregation**
   - Building logic to collate data from multiple sources.
4. **AI Orchestration**
   - Integrating LangChain, Crew AI and establishing workflow for prompt processing.
5. **End-to-End Testing and CI/CD Setup**
   - Ensuring system stability and automated testing.
6. **Monitoring, Documentation, and Finalization**
   - Implementing logging, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive system documentation.

## Additional Materials
- **API Endpoints Documentation:** See [docs/api_endpoints.md](api_endpoints.md)
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Implementing advanced error handling, logging improvements, rate limiting, and retry logic.
  - Exploring additional AI capabilities as integration needs evolve.

This document will be updated as the project evolves to reflect new insights and refinements in the design and implementation strategies.
